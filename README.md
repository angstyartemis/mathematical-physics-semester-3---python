# mathematical-physics-semester-3---python
In this repository. I post the programs I had made in python during the third semester of my physics honors degree for Mathematical physics coursework.
Libraries such as numpy, malplotlib and pandas were exclusively used for the tasks.
The programs include solving differential equations, interpolation, system of linear equation and special polynomials.
One of the most fun parts of the semester was working with the SIR model and its several advances versions to study the extent of COVID-19
